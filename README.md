# Face_Recognition_System
The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Face Recognition System is an innovative project that leverages the power of artificial neural networks to identify and recognize faces.
The project aims to develop a robust and efficient face recognition system using the MLP model, a type of feedforward artificial neural network.
